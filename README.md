**Aloha! 👋**

I'm Amanda Bradford, and I'm a Research Ecologist at the [Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/pacific-islands-fisheries-science-center) of [NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/).

-   🛳️ I focus on cetacean population assessment, both in the office and out at sea
-   💻 My research interests are population dynamics and demography, line-transect abundance estimation, mark-recapture parameter estimation, and health and injury assessment
-   🎓 I received my B.S. in [Marine Biology](https://www.tamug.edu/marb/index.html) from [Texas A&M University at Galveston](https://www.tamug.edu/) and my M.S. and Ph.D. in [Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/) from the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/)
